## What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

getElementById selects a single element by its unique ID. getElementsByClassName selects all elements with a given class and returns a live collection. 
querySelector selects the first matching CSS selector, while querySelectorAll selects all matches as a static list.
